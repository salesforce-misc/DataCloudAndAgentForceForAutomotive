Customer Question:{!$Input:Question}
Provide the response from below information .

Can I test drive at home?
Thank you for your interest! Yes, we do offer home test drives for qualifying vehicles in certain areas. To schedule one, simply let us know your preferred time and location, and we&apos;ll arrange for one of our agents to bring the car to you. We want to make your car-buying experience as convenient as possible! Please feel free to provide any additional details about the car you&apos;re interested in, and we&apos;ll take care of the rest.

What is the wait time for delivery?
The delivery time depends on several factors, including the vehicle&apos;s availability and your location. Typically, in-stock cars are delivered within a week. However, customized vehicles may take up to 3 months. Rest assured, we’ll do our best to get your car to you as quickly as possible.

Why is the check engine light blue?
Thank you for your question! A blue check engine light usually indicates that the engine isn’t functioning optimally. This can happen if the engine temperature is outside of the normal range or if there&apos;s an issue with one of the engine’s systems.
It’s important to have this checked out as soon as possible to prevent any further complications. We recommend scheduling a service appointment where we can perform a detailed diagnostic to pinpoint the cause of the light. Let us know if you&apos;d like to book an appointment, and we&apos;ll get everything taken care of!

Why is my battery showing only 30%?
Thanks for reaching out! A 30% battery health reading suggests that the battery may not be performing at its best. Over time, electric car batteries can lose capacity, which can result in faster draining or reduced range.
We recommend scheduling a diagnostic check to assess the battery’s condition and determine if a replacement or further action is needed. Let us know if you&apos;d like to book an appointment, and we’ll take care of the rest!

Can you share the diagnosis for the charging light not working when the car battery is charging?
Thanks for reaching out! If the charging light isn&apos;t working while the car is charging, there are a few possible causes. One common issue could be a faulty indicator light — the light itself may be malfunctioning, even though the battery is still charging properly. Another potential
cause is an electrical system issue, such as a wiring problem, which could prevent the light from functioning, even when charging is happening as expected. In some cases, there may be an issue with the Battery Management System (BMS) or its sensors, which could be preventing the light from turning on. To get to the bottom of it, we recommend bringing the vehicle in for a diagnostic check. Our team can run a full system scan to identify the root cause and ensure everything is functioning properly. Let us know if you&apos;d like to book an appointment, and we&apos;ll get everything taken care of!

Can you explain the meaning of the P0300 diagnostic trouble codes (DTC) for the vehicle?
Thanks for reaching out! The P0300 code indicates a random/multiple cylinder misfire. This means the engine is experiencing misfires in more than one cylinder, and it’s happening randomly. Common causes include faulty spark plugs or ignition coils, fuel system issues, vacuum leaks, or low compression. It’s important to inspect the ignition and fuel systems to identify the cause.
